/*
 * How trips move between phones without a server. Two formats carry the same records:
 *
 * - Backup files (`Backup`): all trips, or one trip saved as a file. JSON, readable.
 * - Trip links: one trip packed into the link's `#` fragment (see src/lib/tripLink.ts), sent
 *   through any chat app. Its records leave out `tripId`, which is the trip's own id.
 *
 * Photos and documents (attachments) go in neither when a trip is sent to someone: their files can't
 * travel in a link, so trip links and trip files leave out their records too. Backups of this phone
 * keep the records (names, captions), without the files.
 *
 * Both are merged the same way: record by record, the newer `updatedAt` wins, and deletions are
 * records too. Merging is safe to repeat and in any order, so everyone in a group ends up with the
 * same trip however the links went round.
 *
 * Every format version ever shipped must keep loading (sent links and old backups can't be
 * changed): add a version instead of changing one, and keep reading the old ones.
