 * Wire format between the app and the optional waypoints sync server (server/). Shared by both sides:
 * the server runs this file directly, so it has no runtime dependencies. Keep it backward compatible
 * both ways: phones with older versions of the app keep talking to newer servers, and the other way
 * round. Add optional fields and new endpoints rather than changing existing ones.
 *
 * Model: the server has members (people), each with their own devices (one token per phone).
 * Members who joined with the server code are admins: only they invite new people. A trip on the
 * server can be seen and changed only by the members linked to its travellers (`Traveller.memberId`),
 * which the server checks on every request. That link merges on its own clock (`linkedAt`), apart
 * from the rest of the traveller, on both sides (see withNewerLink in ./sync.ts).
